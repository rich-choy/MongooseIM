# Prompt for Custom MongooseIM Presence Notification Module

You are an expert Erlang and XMPP developer. Your task is to write a MongooseIM extension module (Erlang, `mod_presence_notify`) that will notify a specific server user whenever any user's presence changes (available, unavailable, or status update).

## Requirements
- The module should hook into the presence stanza handling pipeline.
- On every presence change from any user, it should send a message or notification to the server user JID. We are interested only in these statuses: `available`, `unavailable`.
- **The server JID's local part must be configurable via the environment variable `WORLD_SERVER_USERNAME`.**
- The module should be configurable for the target server user JID.
- The notification should include the user's JID and the new presence state.
- The module should be robust and production-ready, following MongooseIM best practices.
- Provide clear instructions for compiling, deploying, and configuring the module in `mongooseim.toml`.

## Before Starting Work

- Verify that the project

## Output
- Complete Erlang source code for the module.
- Example configuration snippet for `mongooseim.toml`.
- Step-by-step instructions for compilation and deployment.
